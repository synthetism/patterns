# Patterns

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m 0en, and this is my collection of software patterns. Battle-tested, refined, and unified across hundreds of my projects and Synet network protocol.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @synet/patterns
```

**Why?**

We all use patterns. I used them everywhere: in products, libraries, and experiments. But over time, I realized that patterns, when reused and evolved in isolation, become incompatible. This leads to inconsistencies, cognitive load, and subtle(and heisen)bugs. I found myself importing the same pattern from different libraries, each with its own quirks, instead of using a single, consistent, and well-tested interface. 

**So I built Patterns.**

Other many years in big-tech and enterprise work, I've collected and successfully used many patterns. This library unites all my best patterns and libraries under one set of stable, maintained, and carefully crafted patterns. I use these patterns myself, and I maintain them with care. 

**Use them if you want to live** Theyâ€™re highly stable, consistent, and designed to make your codebase better. Typesafety will save you a hundred years of your lifetime (or kill you). 

Especially useful, when exposed to AI. It quickly learns the patterns and offer you working consistent solutions our of the box.

## Base Patterns

Each pattern has its own documentation and examples in [Docs](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/)

- **Result** Represent the outcome of operations that might fail, with a simple, type-safe API [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/result.md)
- **Value Object** Immutable objects defined by their property values, not identity [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/value-object.md)
- **Mapper** Transform between domain and infrastructure models, keeping your domain logic clean [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/mapper.md)
- **Guard** Type-safe validation helpers for strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and dates [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/guard.md)
- **UniqueId** Type-safe, immutable unique identifiers (UUID v4 by default) [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/unique-id.md)
- **Mediator** Decouple request/response logic with a central dispatcher [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/mediator.md)
- **Specification** Encapsulate and compose business rules and queries [TBD]
- **Observer & EventEmitter** Event-driven architecture, decoupling components with observer/subject and event emitter patterns  [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/observer.md) | [EventEmitter](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/event-emitter.md)
- **Command Bus** - Advanced version of Mediator made for commands. Powered by intuitive middlewares, logging and integrated EventEmitter. It's a gift. [Read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/command-bus.md)

## Realtime Communication Patterns

Unified abstractions for realtime communication (Supabase, WebSocket, NATS, GUN etc). [read more](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/realtime/realtime.md). You can plug in any transport in minutes, create adapters and switch between transports without changing events structure. 

#### Client Side

[Realtime Client](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/realtime/realtime-service.md) - Connect any provider, custom (websocket,nats gun) or databases like Supabase/Neon.

[Realtime Service](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/realtime/realtime-service.md) (Depricated, but working)

[Realtime Provider &amp; Channel](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/realtime/realtime-provider-channel.md) - Consumer patterns for implementing provider and channel for client consumption with examples, similar to what Supabase has done in supabase-js to enable Realtime events.

You can find Nats and Websocket, and Gun provider,channel and client  implementations are in the [examples](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/examples/realtime/client) 

#### Server Side

[Realtime Server](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/realtime/realtime-server.md)  is the implemenation of server-side events broadcasting, sharing RealtimeEvent type and methodology.


You can find Nats and Websocket server example implementations are in the [examples](https://github.com/anton-ecom/patterns/blob/main/docs/examples/realtime/server)

I maintain these patterns for my own projects, but PRs and issues are welcome!
